# Always-TouchID (In development)
*The goal of the tweak is to disable the "Touch ID does not recoginze your fingerprint" prompt which shows up after 5 failed fingerprint unlock attempt and allows further attempts.
*At current stage, the API responsible for the prommpt and failed attempt count are still not found. This readme will be udpated as the development progress. It is possible that the counter is a hardware resides in SoC isolated from the system. In that case it is impossible to disable the prompt.
